The Orbital Widget Toolkit is a cross-platform (G)UI toolkit for building scalable user interfaces with the programming language Rust. It's based
on the [Entity Component System Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) and provides a [functional Reactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming)-like API.

The main goals of OrbTk are speed, ease of use, and cross-platform compatibility.

## Documentation

### Build and open documentation

You can build and view the latest documentation by executing the following command:

```text
cargo doc --no-deps --open
```

### OrbTk book

The OrbTk book is written from a developers perspective. It aims to
introduce the basic concept, beside a bird's eye view of the toolkit
structure. An in depth discussion of the provided crates is followed
by example listings. This section collects example code with annotated
blocks. The annotations are targeting best practice usage of available
widgets, their interaction with other modules coupled with a
descriptive text where reasonable.

A precompiled version is available for [online](https://github.com/redox-os/orbtk-book/wiki) reading.
You are invited to checkout its repository at [OrbTk book](https://github.com/redox-os/orbtk-book).

Please do **not** expect at finalized version. It is not complete at
all. The given statis is `marked as work in progress` (WIP). Any help to
improve the chapters and/or translations are quite welcome.

## Usage

To include OrbTk as an external dependency into your project, add this
line to its `Cargo.toml` file:

```text
...
[dependencies]
...
orbtk = "0.3.1-alpha4"
...
```

To use the latest development version of OrbTk as an external
dependency, add this line into its `Cargo.toml` file:

```text
...
[dependencies]
...
orbtk = { git = "https://github.com/redox-os/orbtk.git", branch = "develop" }
...
```

You can also check out the OrbTk template project to start a new
project: https://github.com/redox-os/orbtk-template

## Minimal Example

```rust
use orbtk::prelude::*;

fn main() {
	  Application::new()
		.window(|ctx| {
			Window::new()
				.title("OrbTk - minimal example")
				.position((100.0, 100.0))
				.size(420.0, 730.0)
				.child(TextBlock::new().text("OrbTk").build(ctx))
				.build(ctx)
		})
		.run();
}
```

## Base concepts

### Widget

Widgets are the building blocks of user interfaces in OrbTk. They are
things like Buttons, TextBoxes, ListViews, Views (Screens) and
Grid(Layout)s. Each widget implements the [Widget
trait](https://github.com/redox-os/orbtk/blob/develop/orbtk_core/src/widget_base/mod.rs)
and is generated by the [widget!
macro](https://github.com/redox-os/orbtk/blob/develop/orbtk_core/src/macros.rs). A
widget consists of a name like `Button` and a list of its properties
like `text: String`, `background: Brush` or `count: u32`. After the
`build` method of a widget is called it's added to the Entity
Component System where it exists as an `Entity` (index) with
`Components`. The struct of a widget serves as a builder using the
[builder
pattern](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/ownership/builders.html).

Basic usage of the widget! macro:

```rust
widget!(
	MyWidget {
	  background: Brush,
	  count: u32,
	  text: String,
	  ...
	}
);
```

### Widget Templates

Each widget has to implement the [Template
trait](https://github.com/redox-os/orbtk/blob/develop/orbtk_core/src/widget_base/template.rs).
The template defines the structure and the default values that the
widget will store in its properties. For example: You can define your
hand-crafted `Button` widget (lets call it `MyButton`). `MyButton` is
represented as a tree of three child widgets: A top level
`Container` widget that will hand over to its child, the `StackPanel`
widget, which in turn will hand over to its child, the `TextBlock`
widget.

The next code snippet prints out the source code of this basic Template trait:

```rust
impl Template for MyButton {
	fn template(self, id: Entity, ctx: &mut BuildContext) -> Self {
		 self.name("MyButton")
			.style("my_button_style")
			.background("#000000")
			.count(0)
			.text("Initial text")
			.child(Container::new()
					// Container references the same background as MyButton
					.background(id)
					.child(TextBlock::new()
							// TextBlock references the same text as MyButton
							.text(id)
							.build(ctx)
					)
					.build(ctx)
			)
	}
}
```

### Widget State

Any changes that are triggered via user interaction or via events are
handled inside the state of a widget. If generated, they are processed
to manipulate the inner state. Each state must implement the [State
trait](https://github.com/redox-os/orbtk/blob/develop/orbtk_core/src/widget_base/state.rs).
The inner state of a widget is represented by the current values of
its properties.

Have a look at this code snippet to make up a state trait:

```rust
#[derive(Default, AsAny)]
struct MyState {
	...
}

impl State for MyState {
	fn update(&mut self, _: &mut Registry, ctx: &mut Context) {
		// update the widget
		...
	}
}

widget!(
	// Add MyState as state of MyWidget
	MyWidget<MyState> {
		...
	}
);
```

The update method requires a [`Context`
parameter](https://github.com/redox-os/orbtk/blob/develop/orbtk_core/src/widget_base/context.rs).
This structure provides access to the state's widget itself (the `entity`)
and its components (the `properties`). It also provides methods (the `associated functions`) to access
the children of the widget, this it is able to manipulate the widget tree.

### Styling widgets and define themes

OrbTk provides a `theme engine` base on
[RON](https://github.com/ron-rs/ron). The engine provides the
following features:

* Split theme in different files
* Reference resources values in the theme files (colors, font stuff)
* Derive styles
* Dynamic theme switching
* State styling (pressed | selected | focused | disabled)

Have a look at this short style definition:

```ron
Theme (
	styles: {
		"base": (
			properties: {
				"font_size": "$FONT_SIZE_12",
				"font_family": "$MEDIUM_FONT",
			}
		),
		"button": (
			base: "base",
			properties: {
				"background": "$BLACK",
			},
			states: [
				(
					key: "pressed",
					properties: {
						"background": "$WHITE",
					}
				)
			]
		)
	},
	resource: {
		"BLACK": "#000000",
		"WHITE": "#ffffff",
		"MEDIUM_FONT": "Roboto-Medium",
		"FONT_SIZE_12": 12,
		"FONT_SIZE_16": 16,
	}
)
```

But you are not requested to reference a theme engine. OrbTk
enables as well the declaraton of property values inside the source
code (`inlined theming`).

### Localization

OrbTk supports the functionality to register an application wide
localization service. A localization service has to implement the
[Localization](https://github.com/redox-os/orbtk/blob/develop/orbtk_core/src/localization/mod.rs)
trait.

*Example*

```rust
pub struct MyLocalization {
	...
}

impl Localization for MyLocalization {
	/// Gets the current language by language key e.g. `en_US` or `de_DE`.
	fn language(&self) -> &String {
		...
	}

	/// Sets the current language by key e.g. `en_US` or `de_DE`.
	fn set_language(&mut self, key: &str) {
		...
	}

	/// Gets the translated text for the given key. If there is no given translation the `key` will be returned as result.
	fn text(&self, key: String) -> String {
		...
	}
}
```

It is possible to register a localization service for an
application. Simply make use of the
[RonLocalization](https://github.com/redox-os/orbtk/blob/develop/orbtk_core/src/localization/ron_localization/mod.rs),
that can read localization dictionaries coded in the
[RON](https://github.com/ron-rs/ron) format.

*Example*

```rust
let de_de = r#"
	Dictionary(
		words: {
			"hello": "Hallo",
			"world": "Welt",
		}
	)
	"#;

Application::new()
	.localization(
		RonLocalization::create()
			// sets the initial language
			.language("en_US")
			// adds an language dictionary to the localization service.
			.dictionary("de_DE", de_de)
			.build()
	)
	.window(|ctx| {
		Window::new()
			.title("OrbTk - showcase example")
			.position((100, 100))
			.size(600, 730)
			.resizable(true)
			.child(TextBlock::new().text("hello").build(ctx))
			.build(ctx)
	})
	.run();
```

Inside this example code the `text` property (value **hello**) is used
as the `key`. This key is matched to the correponding `value` inside the
dictionary of the corresponding localization service. If you haven't defined a
dictionary for the current language, OrbTk will simply take the value of the property itself.
You are free to start development without and any localization, but add it afterwards.

You may switch the language at runtime. Inside the state widget you simply consume the `set_language` method, that is accessible via the
[Context](https://github.com/redox-os/orbtk/blob/develop/orbtk_core/src/widget_base/context.rs)
structure.

## Run Examples

### Build with sdl2 installation

If your target Operating-System is `Linux`, `macOS` or `Windows`, a
`sdl2` installation is required. Please check the documentation that
is provieded for th [`rust-sdk2` crate](
https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2).

### Build with sdl2 from source

As an alternative, you may build `OrbTk` while bundling `sdl2`. To activate the `bundled` feature go ahead like this:

```shell
cargo run --example showcase --features bundled
```

Please asure, that you `toolchain` will provide a *working* C compiler (e.g. `gcc`, `clang`, or MS's compiler).

To target `linux`, you also need to provide `cmake`:

```shell
sudo apt install cmake
```

If you have trouble build the provided OrbTk examples or simply don't want to
use a C compiler, please check the backend section. It contains
alternatives.

All example source-code resides inside the [`examples` subdirectory](./orbtk/examples) of the orbtk subcrate.

Compile, start and play around with the `showcase` example while executing the following command:

```text
cargo run --example showcase --release
```

OrbTk has an integrated `debug` tools. It will oultline the bounds of
all managed widgets inside the widget tree. This will include
invisible ones.  You may also want to print out the tree structure of your app.
This is activated, via feature flags like this:

```text
cargo run --example showcase --release --features "debug, log"
```

## Run Examples with cargo-node

To run the examples as a browser, electron or cordova app you have to install cargo-node:

```text
cargo install -f cargo-node
```

`cargo-node` itself relies on `npm` version 6.9.0, which is included with `Node.js` version 10.16.3. You can download it
from  its [homepage](https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.16.3/).

Rust's `cargo` is also required. All cargo-node's dependencies are installed automatically.

### Start examples

To start the `showcase` example as a node binary, executing one of the following commands:

* Run as browser app:

```text
cargo node run --target browser --example showcase
```

* Run as electron app:

```text
cargo node run --target electron --example showcase
```

* Run as cordova app on android:

```text
cargo node run --target android --example showcase
```
