> OrbTk 0.3.0 is under heavy development and it's not compatible to earlier releases.

The Orbital Widget Toolkit is a multi platform (G)UI toolkit for building scalable user interfaces with the programming language Rust. It's based
on the [Entity Component System Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93component%E2%80%93system) and provides a functional-reactive API. 

The main goals of OrbTk are fast peformance, easy to use and the platform indipendence.

## Features:

* Modern [Flutter](https://flutter.io/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) like API
* Uses the Entity Component System library [DCES](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/dces-rust) for widget and properties handling
* Updating instead of rebuling subtrees
* Small DSL for custom widget creation on macro base (WIP)
* Flexible event system
* Widget state management
* Platform Independent: Redox OS, Linux, macOS, Windows
* CSS theming

## Usage

To include OrbTk in your project, just add the dependency
line to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```text
orbtk = "0.2.27"
```

To use OrbTk 0.3, just add the dependency
line to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```text
orbtk = { git = https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/orbtk.git }
```

However you also need to have the SDL2 libraries installed on your
system.  The best way to do this is documented [by the SDL2
crate](https://github.com/AngryLawyer/rust-sdl2#user-content-requirements).

You will also need to use the [nightly build of Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs/blob/master/README.md#working-with-nightly-rust) to use OrbTk. 

## Examples

You find the examples in the `examples/` directory.

You can start the widgets example by executing the following command:

```text
cargo run --example widgets
```

## Planned features

* Style guide
* More default widgets
* More examples
* Book
* Animations
* Exchange views / widgets / screens on runtime
* Split application in modules
* Theme update
* Support for Android, iOS and WebAssembly
* Vulkan / OpenGL Support 

## Inspirations

* [Flutter](https://flutter.io/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
